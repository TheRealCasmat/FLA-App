<h2>About</h2>
<p><b>Image Identifier</b> is a site that can take image input using the <a href=https://pqina.nl/filepond/>Filepond</a> library to predict the class the image belongs to. This process is done all in your browser using <a href=https://www.tensorflow.org/js>TensorFlow.js</a>, where the model uses MobileNetV3 as its base for feature extraction, with a custom head trained on the Caltech 256 dataset for classification. The UI was made using React/Tailwind/DaisyUI.</p>
